                The GAIA Data Release 3 (GDR3) stores data for public use in comma seperated value (CSV)
                files. The Aurvandil software reads these files, determines the HEALPix pixel each star lies in, 
                then adds it to the respective pixel database.

            <h1>Adding Files</h1>
            <p>
                Before you begin, ensure that the target database is currently running and enter the PostgreSQL
                database ip address, port, username and password into the database fields. Click the "Advanced Commands"
                cascading menu, and select "Add Files". A dialog will open up, confirm that the files you intend to commit
                are in the "UncommittedFiles" folder and select "Yes". A progress dialog will appear to track the progress
                of the commit. This process takes some time and if you intend to stop the commit, select "Cancel" in the
                dialog. A cancelling dialog will appear to inform that the cancel operation has started and to not close
                the program. Closing the program prior to the cancel operation finishing may result in either missing or
                duplicate data in the database. Once the cancellation process is finished and closed, you may close the
                program.

            <h1>Technical Explanation</h1>
			<p>
                The Aurvandil software makes use of the <a href="https://healpix.sourceforge.io/">HEALPix Java library</a>
                to organize the stars into pixels of equal area on the celestial sphere. The HEALPix library comes with
                functionality to convert a set of coordinates to a location on the HEALPix sphere that correspondes to a
                a specific pixel. The GAIA data release 3 (gdr3) stores the right ascension in degrees in a range of 0 to
                360 degrees and the declination in degrees from -90 to 90 degrees. These values must be converted to HEALPix
                coordinates that range from 0 to Pi for latitude and longitude. The star data is then added as a row to
                the pixel's corresponding PostgreSQL database.
