            <h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
                While it is recommended that an already existing database is used and the user has some experience with
                PostgreSQL, there are a number of existing commands the user can utilize to quickly create a PostgreSQL
                database to be used with Aurvandil.

        <div class="body-info">
            <h1>Windows</h1>
			<p>
                Within the Aurvandil directory, the folder labeled "UtilityToolsWindows" holds the commands to create,
                start, and stop a PostgreSQL database cluster as well as the dependencies for PostgreSQL to allow for
                portable use of the database. Running the "createDatabaseCluster.bat" batch file will create a new folder
                in the Aurvandil directory labeled "PostgreSQLDatabase" and initialize a new cluster. Once the batch
                window has closed the "startDatabaseCluster.bat" batch file can be run to start the database. The new
                database will run on port "8080" and the superuser will be the name of the current Windows user. The
                settings for this database in Aurvandil will be:<br><br>
                Database IP: localhost<br>
                Port: 8080<br>
                Database Name: gaia<br>
                Username: (CURRENT_WINDOWS_USER)<br>
                Password: (empty)<br><br>

                The database can be accessed directly by running the "connectToServer.bat" batch file. From here, new
                users can be created, debugging, and other maintenance operations can be performed. It is recommended
                that the user has some experience with PostgreSQL before connecting directly to the database cluster.

                Within the Aurvandil directory, the folder labeled "UtilityToolsLinux" holds the commands to create,

                need to be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">PostgreSQL website</a>
