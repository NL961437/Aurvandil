            <h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
                Aurvandil is a database software to store and access the star data from the GAIA satellite archive. The
                current version of the software is built to handle the Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3). Current capabilities
                of the software allow Aurvandil to build HEALPix sphere databases within PostgreSQL, add stars to that
                database from the
                <a href="http://cdn.gea.esac.esa.int/Gaia/gdr3/gaia_source/">GAIA GDR3 source files</a>, and cone
                search for stars with filters for any of the parameters listed in the GDR3 files.

            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <p>
                The GAIA DR3 is the third data release from the GAIA satellite owned by the European Space Agency and the
                ESA hosts a publicly available SQL based database that anyone can make queries to. While working on a
                separate project involving the GAIA GDR3 source data, it was found that the remote queries to the ESA's
                database were incredibly slow, sometimes taking more than an hour to retrieve the results of one query.
                The ESA also does not publicly provide a copy of their database for anyone to download and so, the
                Aurvandil project was created to fill this need. Having local access to the database allows for
                significantly faster query times, reducing a query that would normally take hours down to a few minutes.

            <h1>Value Of PostgreSQL/HEALPix</h1>
            <p>
                On beginning this project, I had to select some kind of system that could hold billions of rows of data
                with many different data type columns within each row that could be queried to find a particular row or
                set of rows that fell under user selected criteria. The obvious choice for this was a Structured Query
                Language (SQL) based data server. PostgreSQL is a branch of SQL server and was chosen as it has a good
                reputation and is constantly being maintained and improved. Though the PostgreSQL server can hold the
                billions of rows within the GAIA GDR3, making queries to search through all the rows is inefficient as
                any query no matter how simple could take hours. This dilemma is solved by a data structure known as
                HEALPix, an imaginary sphere divided into segments of equal area called "pixels". Using a tool such as
                the HEALPix Java Library, coordinates can be converted to a location on this sphere and the
                corresponding pixel can be found, allowing for the storage and retrieval of data. The subdivisions of
                the sphere mean that only the pixels that fall within the query need to be searched, so instead of
                searching the entire database for stars that lie within a 5 degree radius of a point, it only needs to
                search pixels that fall within a 5 degree radius of that point.

            <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Duplicate protection should be introduced to protect against file read errors that cause duplicates</li>
                <li>Java's SQL library seems to have a memory hole in it somewhere, leading large queries that cover
                several HEALPix pixel tables to become slower on each query of a table. Either switching to a more
                optimized library or manually closing the connection after each query may solve this issue.</li>
