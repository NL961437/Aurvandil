            <h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
                Cone Searching works by casting an invisible cone onto a specific 
                point in the sky (measured in right ascension and declination) with
                a radius on the sky (measured in degrees).

            <h1>How To Query</h1>
            <p>
                Before you begin, ensure that the target database is currently running. Enter the PostgreSQL
                database ip address, port, username and password into the database fields, and the right ascension
                (0 to 360 degrees), declination (-90 to 90 degrees), and radius (in degrees) into the querying fields.
                Click the query button and wait for the query to finish. The final query will be stored in the "Queries"
                folder in the Aurvandil directory. If the program freezes, you may have too much data in too small of a
                HEALPix nesting value. If this occurs, either use less data or increase the number of HEALPix nests.

            <h1>Technical Explanation</h1>
			<p>
                Because of the nature of longitudinal lines converging at the poles, a simple search 
                for all stars within a specific number of degrees will return a strange result. This 
                requires the use of a formula to be able to accurately determine how far a point is 
                from another point on a sphere. A common formula for this is known as the Haversine 
                formula. The Aurvandil software uses an imaginary sphere with a circumference of 
                36000 units (1 degree = 100 units) to determine the distance a star is from the origin
                point of the cone search.
