            <h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
                With the aid of the <a href="https://healpix.sourceforge.io/">HEALPix Java library</a>,
                a sphere with equally sized tesselations can be created to allow for an even distribution
                of stars across an imaginary HEALPix sphere.

        <div class="body-info">
            <h1>Creating a Sphere</h1>
			<p>
                Before attempting to destroy a sphere, ensure the target PostgreSQL database is currently
                running and the database settings within Aurvandil are correct. In the Aurvandil software, select the
                "Advanced Commands" dropdown in the top left of the window. Select "Build HEALPix Sphere" and an input
                dialog will appear. Enter a valid number of nests for each HEALPix pixel (See the HEALPix Pixel Size
                explanation below if you are unsure what this means). It is recommended that the user chooses
                a nest value greater than 3 if they intend to use the raw GAIA GDR3 Source data as smaller nests
                can cause errors when querying.

            <h1>HEALPix Pixel Size</h1>
			<p>
                The Aurvandil software has the ability to create an imaginary HEALPix sphere and then 
                add each pixel of the sphere as a table to the target database. A HEALPix sphere with a nesting 
                size of 1 has 12 individual pixels. Each additional nesting will divide each pixel into 
                four separate pixels. (eg. nesting=2 has 48 pixels, nesting=3 has 192 pixels)
