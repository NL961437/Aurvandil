            <h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
                The <a href="https://github.com/NL961437/AurvandilSrc">Aurvandil Source Files</a>
                are organized similar to the Java Spring Web Framework and helps promote a more
                organized workspace. The purpose of each of the packages is described in more detail below.
			</p>
		</div>

        <div class="body-info">
            <h1>Business Actions (BA)</h1>
			<p>
                Java files stored in the BA (Business Actions) package are designed to handle the main logic
                of the program. Business actions in this program make queries and additions to the PostgreSQL
                database and create HEALPix spheres.
			</p>
            <h1>Controllers</h1>
            <p>
                The controllers package is responsible for controllers that delegate actions to the program
                Business Actions (BA) package to complete the main functions of the program. In Aurvandil,
                the actions controlled are adding files, counting stars, creating and destroying HEALPix
                spheres, and running cone search queries.
            </p>
            <h1>Data Access Objects (DAO)</h1>
            <p>
                Data Access Objects handle the interactions between physical files and the information
                in the program. Instances of this include objects to read GAIA source files and write
                queries to CSV files.
            </p>
            <h1>Graphical User Interface Objects (GUI)</h1>
            <p>
                The Graphical User Interface (GUI) package handles the main Aurvandil GUI window that the user
                will see. Responsible for building the fields to be used for querying, database selection, and
                desired parameters.
            </p>
            <h1>Action Listeners</h1>
            <p>
                The Action Listeners package is found within the GUI package and is responsible for handling
                a variety of button actions in the GUI such as the "Run Query" and saving settings on window
                close.
            </p>
            <h1>Utilities (Util)</h1>
            <p>
                The Utilities package holds useful Java files with static methods that are routinely reused
                in different parts of the program. Some of these responsibilities are file management utilities
                and static methods to calculate and check values.
            </p>
            <h1>Main Aurvandil Controller</h1>
            <p>
                The main Aurvandil Controller is the Aurvandil.java file. The main controller handles the base
                operations of the program and is best used for debugging different parts of the program.
